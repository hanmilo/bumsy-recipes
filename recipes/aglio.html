    <p><em>&ldquo;My wife & I concocted this recipe for a quick tasty & healthy workday lunch at home before having to return to our desks shortly.&rdquo;
    </em></p>
    <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>Serving: 2</h4>
        <li>Pasta Linguini - ~140g (~weight of a cellphone)</li>
        <li>Extra virgin Olive oil - ~70ml (~35ml of Olive oil to every 70g of Pasta)</li>
        <li>Italian herbs - 2 dashes or more (1 dash per serving)</li>
        <li>Tomatoes - 1 piece (or 6 pieces of Cherry Tomatoes)</li>
        <h4>Optional:</h4>
        <li>Shredded Mozerella Cheese - ~50g (depending on your cheese preference)</li>
        <li>Chicken Eggs - 2</li>
        <li>Meat - Minced Chicken/Bacon/Patty (Amount depends on personal preference)</li>
        <h4><u>Notes</u></h4>
        <p>Olive oil grade matters most.
        </p>
        <p>Including meat lets us use its oil to enhance the pasta's flavor.
        </p>
    </ul>

        <li>Start a kettle with ~700ml of water</li>
        <li>Place the Chicken Eggs in a heat-resistant glass bowl & pour the heated kettle water into it gradually (to minimize eggs from cracking from the heat)</li>

        <li>Add meat (if any) into the wok and cook until it is ready to serve</li>
        <li>Pour the Pasta Linguini back into the wok and stir it to get the Olive oil coat (add more Olive oil as needed)</li>
        <li>Add the Mozerella Cheese into the wok and stir the pasta with it for ~5 minutes (spread & melt the cheese across the pasta)</li>
