This repository holds the HTML segment concluding assignment of The Odin Project.
Bumsy is a lovely cat this page is named after.

Revision:
1. <\strong> vs <\b>, <\em> vs <\i>.
2. <\marquee>, a favorite of mine at 11, has sadly been relegated.
3. &ldquo/lsquo and &rdquo/rsquo are new features I found more elegant.
4. <\a href="..." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> appreciate the 'rel' integration in the later HTML for phishing security.
5. Subject-Line Break-Body sequence for commenting on commits for clarity saves time for the team and a similar approach I use for emails.
